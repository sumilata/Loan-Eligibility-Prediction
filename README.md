<p><b>Aim:</b> Our concentration is on developing a more sustainable model that predicts whether the applicant gets loan approval or not. We focus on implementing various supervised machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree.</p>

<p><b>Dataset Description:</b> In this project, we have used two datasets, namely dataSet_1 and dataSet_2. The dataSet_1 is for training purposes, and our task is to predict whether the applicant gets loan approval or not from the test dataset dataSet_2. Features like Loan_ID, Gender, Married, Dependents, Education, Self_Employed, Applicant_Income, Coapplicant_Income, LoanAmount, Credit History, Property_Area, and Loan_Status have been taken into consideration for accurately estimating the loan approval.<p>

<p><b>Evaluation and Result:</b> We have trained the model first and then evaluated it. We find that all these algorithms can predict loan approval. The outcome is compared on the basis of the RÂ² score. The best performance was achieved by the logistic regression model, with DT-72.97%, LR-85.36%, and RF-73.64%. The prediction made by the algorithms will help to know if the applicant gets loan approval or not.</p>
